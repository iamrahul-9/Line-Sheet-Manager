# Product Context: Line Sheet Manager

## Why This Project Exists

The Line Sheet Manager was created to solve common challenges faced by fashion businesses when creating and distributing line sheets for their collections. Line sheets are essential sales tools in the fashion industry, used to present product information to buyers, retailers, and other stakeholders. Traditional methods of creating line sheets often involve:

1. Manual design work in graphic design software
2. Time-consuming formatting and layout adjustments
3. Difficulty in updating product information quickly
4. Challenges in distributing and sharing updated line sheets
5. Inconsistent presentation across different collections

This application streamlines the entire process, from data entry to distribution, saving time and ensuring professional, consistent presentation of product lines.
